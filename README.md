# Crouch-Jump
A customizable Spigot 1.16.5 plugin that temporarily gives players Jump Boost when they crouch. Works on versions Release 1.1 and above.

# Features
- The time window that allows players to crouch-jump can be easily edited
- The jump boost amplifier that's applied to players when they crouch can be easily edited
- Effect stacking allows players that already have the jump boost status effect to crouch-jump even higher
- Crouch-jumping can be locked behind permissions
- Vast version support - this plugin is so simple to the point where it'll (probably) work with every version past Release 1.0
